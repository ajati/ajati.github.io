Hello! I'm Arindam Jati, a Staff Research Scientist at [**IBM Research**](https://research.ibm.com) in Bangalore, India. My work primarily revolves around creating AI applications for Industry 4.0, with a specific focus on building robust time series foundation models.

I earned my PhD in Electrical Engineering from the [**University of Southern California (USC)**](https://www.usc.edu/) under the guidance of [**Prof. Shrikanth Narayanan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrikanth_Narayanan), and my research journey was based at the [**Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (SAIL)**](http://sail.usc.edu). During this academic journey, I also had the privilege of interning at Microsoft Research, WA, USA, and Sony Interactive Entertainment, CA, USA.

Before my time at USC, I gained practical experience as a Software Engineer at [Polaris Networks Inc.](http://www.polarisnetworks.net/) for 2 years. My educational journey began with an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [**Jadavpur University**](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/) in Kolkata, India.

It's been an exciting journey so far, and I'm passionate about exploring the endless possibilities at the intersection of AI, time series, and Industry 4.0.
